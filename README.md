## About The Project

[![NoteUp][product-screenshot]](src/assets/images/project_screenshots/add_note.jpg)

NoteUp is an easy and quick way to keep simple notes across your mobile devices. You can edit you notes instantly, archive them or delete them. Your notes will be saved directly to the firebase cloud using google authentication to keep them private.

**The Goal:**
the main idea is to evolve the application into a Getting Thing Done - GTD tool which will help users apply the principals of this technic. For more details on GTD you can read this article [GTD in 15 minutes](https://hamberg.no/gtd/#what-is-gtd).
